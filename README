This repository contain projects relating to the SERV RISC-V soft core
on FPGAs.

servant_gowin: servant example SoC using Gowin FPGA tools.  Supporting
               boards OneKiwi Kiwi-1P5, Tang Nano 9K, Tang Nano 20k.

serving_proj: serving example SoC (uses one memory for SRAM + register
              file) plus peripherals from servant.  Supporting only
	      OneKiwi Kiwi-1P5, but other boards would be easy to add.
