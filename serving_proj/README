This directory contains a Gowin FPGA tools project (serving_proj.gprj)
for the OneKiwi Kiwi 1P5 FPGA development board.

The project is based on serv: https://github.com/olofk/serv and contains
files from commit f141df190c15d116cc8e71fc4000e28e101a2629 of this
repo.

It runs a sample SoC that is the "serving" SoC with the GPIO
controller and timer from the "servant" SoC.  The difference between
serving and servant is that the former uses a single inferred SRAM
(probably implemented using BSRAM) for both SoC SRAM and the core's
register file.  This improves resource usage a little on FPGAs that
have only 4 BSRAMs.

To run, build using the Gowin Tools and use the Gowin programmer to
load the sample SoC onto the FPGA.  LED2 should blink.

Directory c_code contains a sample program (that blinks the LED).  See
the README there.

The Verilog top level is in src/serving_kiwi_1p5.v.
